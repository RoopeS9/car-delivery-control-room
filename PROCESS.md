# How we worked with AI

A running log of how team Random used coding agents (Claude Code and others)
to build this. Newest entries at the bottom. Format:

## 2026-10-24 · RoopeS + Claude Code · planning

Asked: read the challenge packet (brief, ops context, schema, starter, data) and
summarise the task; then turn our ideation (driver "sink" with AI interview,
OBD2 dongle, journey photos, rulebook-driven agent, dark mode, map) into a plan.

Got: a summary of the brief and the judging weights, demo-worthy cases found in
the data (CD-420322 warning light, CD-420299 sold-out ferry), and a draft plan.

Checked / changed / rejected:
- The agent found the tracking data has no coordinates, so a "live map" would
  invent positions. We chose simulated phone GPS, labelled as simulated.
- It flagged that 22 of 103 vehicles are electric, where standard OBD2 data is
  thin. Demo cases use petrol cars, and the pitch mentions the EV limit.
- It recommended text chat first; we overrode that and chose live voice + chat
  + photos. The plan builds voice as a layer on a working chat agent, so the
  chat path is a fallback.
- Drivability policy: safety-only advice by the agent; "keep driving" needs an
  operator yes.
- Result: `PLAN.md`.

## 2026-10-24 ~12:15 UTC · Claude Code (stream A agent) · M0 foundation

Asked: do M0 (shared contract) since `lib/cr/` did not exist, then move on to
the agent.

Got: `starter/lib/cr/` with `types.ts` (enums, `SourceRef`, `HandoverPacket`,
OBD/GPS shapes), `schema.ts` (six `cr_` tables, no foreign keys into starter
tables), `queries.ts` (store/fetch only; gates stay in `lib/agent`),
`clock.ts` (simulated clock from `SIM_NOW`) and `db.ts`. Drizzle config now
pushes both schemas; agent env vars added to `.env.example`.

Checked / changed / rejected:
- Read `scripts/seed.ts` first: it truncates only starter tables, so `cr_`
  rows survive a reseed. Verified by reseeding with the new tables present.
- `lib/db.ts` imports `server-only`, which throws under `tsx`. Rather than
  edit the starter file, `lib/cr/db.ts` opens its own client so tests and
  scripts can share the same queries as the app.
- Added fields the plan's table list lacked but the UI and gates need:
  `channel` and recipient on events (to audit "never contacted a customer"
  and to render the driver thread), `waiting_on` / `next_step` on cases,
  and `transitionProposal()` that only updates from an expected status so a
  double click cannot execute a proposal twice.
- Customer contact is pinned to ASK_FIRST in two places: `setAutonomy`
  refuses it, and `getAutonomy` ignores any stored row for it.
- No Docker daemon in the cloud machine: ran the system Postgres 16 on port
  5438 instead. Node 22 (not 24) here; seed, typecheck and smoke all pass.
- Left the dark-mode token skeleton (also M0) to stream B, since
  `globals.css` is theirs.
